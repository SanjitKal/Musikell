# Musikell

Progress so far: We have defined types for notes, chords, melodies, and modifications. We have defined and implemented some state
manipulation functions (add, remove, applyMod, etc.).

What needs to be done: We need to figure out how to output actual sounds/how sounds are actually represented. Regarding the scope
of our project: will there be enough depth if we just focus on the composition aspect (excluding the signal aspect)?
